# Eliza Application

### Short Explanation
This program is an interactive chat-bot, also known as Eliza. Eliza is a therapist program that interacts with the user. In short the program works in one of two ways:
1. With a randomly chosen hedge, such as "Please tell me more"
2. By changing some keywords in the user's input string an appending this string to a randomly chosen qualifier. To get a random item from an array, select a random number for one of the array index values and use the value at that index for your qualifier.
